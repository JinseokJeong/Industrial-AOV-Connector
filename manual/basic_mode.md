### **UI default content**
1. **Main Config**: 

    Pre-made recipes for basic mode that controls output style.
2. **Output Settings**: 

    Some toggle for quickly adjusting nodes that are going to be generated.
3. **`Cook Nodetree` button**: 

    Press to generating nodes for all viewlayer, by default it will clear all nodes in compositor, but you can decide whether to keep existing nodes or not, by the toggle above.
4. **`Update Current Viewlayer` button**: 

    Press to generating nodes for current viewlayer only, won't affect any existing nodes other than current viewlayer's output nodes. 
5. **`Arrange Connector Nodes` button**: 

    Press to Arrange nodes associated to Industrial AOV Connector. 
### **UI hidden content**
- **`Delete Useless Default Renders` button**: 

    Hidden by default. This button deletes the folder called 'trash_output' which contains the default render of blender, safe to perform because valid output paths generated by the addon will always locate out of the 'trash_output' folder. 
    
    click `Preference` on the header, Find "Output Tools" section, turn both of the 2 toggles on. 

    `Default useless renders gather` will auto change blender default render output path to "trash_output" subfolder, for convenient dump later

    `Show useless renders clean button` will show "Delete Useless Default Renders" button in Output Tools, for quickly delete "trash_output"
